# You Are Stardust ‚ú®

A beautiful, cosmic-themed web application that combines NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day with inspirational content about our stellar origins. This project reminds visitors that we are literally made of stardust - elements forged in the hearts of ancient stars.

## What It Does

**You Are Stardust** displays stunning astronomy images from NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API alongside educational content about stellar nucleosynthesis - the process by which stars create the elements that make up our bodies. Each visit shows a different cosmic view while telling the story of how we're all connected to the universe.

## Features

- üåü **NASA APOD Integration**: Fetches and displays random astronomy images from NASA's archive
- üîë **API Key Management**: Supports both demo keys and personal NASA API keys with local storage
- ‚ú® **Animated Particle Background**: Twinkling stars create an immersive cosmic atmosphere  
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- üñºÔ∏è **High-Resolution Links**: Click images to view full-resolution versions
- ‚ö° **Smart Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API limits, network issues, and non-image content
- üé® **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, professional appearance
- üíæ **Persistent Settings**: API keys are saved locally for convenience

## How to Use
